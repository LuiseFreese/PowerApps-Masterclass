# How to create a Developer tenant

This is a two step process, where we will first create an Microsoft 365 Developer tenant and then on top of this sign up for a Power Apps Developer plan.

To get a Microsoft 365 Developer plan, you need to sign in with either your work/school account or with a Microsoft account. In case you don't have a Microsoft account, you can create a new email address for that as well.

To make things work smoothly, first [create a new profile in Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/learning-center/how-to-add-new-profiles?form=MA13I2) browser so that you don't need to log in and log out from various tenants.

2. Sign in with either your work/school email or your MIcrosoft account.
