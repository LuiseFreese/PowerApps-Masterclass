# Build an autoheight textinput component

Some controls in Power Apps do not have an auto height property, which means that we can't get the **Height** of a control to automagically âœ¨ adjust to its content. Especially for the textinput control, this is a real bummer, as a user's input is pretty much unpredictable. On the one hand, we do not want to waste precious screen estate by making the box as big as possible, on the other hand, a too small box will result in an endless scrollbar which is a bad user experience.

## Build a component

1. Open [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com)
2. Create a new component `cmp_textinput`
3. Create a custom input property **outsideMargin** (Number), `20` - determines the margin around the component
4. Create a custom output property **userText** (Text), we will hook this later to `txt_userInput.Text` so that we can pass this value back to our app

### Make magic work

1. Insert a text label `lbl_autoHeightHelper` and a textinput `txt_userInput`
2. Make sure that the textinput sits on top
3. Set the **Mode** of the textinput to `Multiline`
4. Set the **X** and **Y** of the textinput to `cmp_textinput.outsideMargin`
5. Set the **Width** of the textinput to `cmp_textinput.Width-2*cmp_textinput.outsideMargin` - this makes sure, that when you horizontally resize the component, this also applies to the textinput as well
6. Set **Height** of the textinput to `Max(42, lbl_autoHeightHelper.Height)`
7. Set the **Text** of the label to `txt_userInput.Text`
8. Set **X** of the label to `txt_userInput.X` and **Y** to `txt_userInput.Y`
9. Set **Width** of the label to `txt_userInput.Width`
10. Set the **Height** of the label to `cmp_textinput.Height-2*cmp_textinput.outsideMargin`
11. Set the **auto height** of the text label to `true`
12. Set the **Color** of the text label to `Color.Transparent`
13. For the text label, set **Font** to  `txt_userInput.Font`, **FontWeight** to `txt_userInput.FontWeight`, and **Size** to `txt_userInput.Size`
14. Set the **Width** of the textinput to `txt_userInput.Width` and the **Height** to `Max(42, lbl_autoHeightHelper.Height)`

### Understand the magic

1. We utilize the auto height property of the text label and hook it to the **Height** property of the text input. The text label will get exactly the text in the Font, Size, FontWeight of the textinput, but as we set the **Color** to `Transparent`, it won't show up.
2. For the **Width** of the text input, we reference the **Width** of the component itself so that we can make the textinput as wide as necessary by adjusting the size of the component instance in an app
3. The `Max(42, lbl_autoHeightHelper.Height)` for the **Height** of the textinput ensures that we always have 42 as a minimum Height and the **Height** of the text label (which has auto height enabled) as maximum Height
